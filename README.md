# Level-1-Task-21--The-command-line-for-web-development

## Task

Follow these steps:

● Create a script file called file_cd. (Remember to save this file with a .bat extension if you are using Windows.)

○ Inside file_cd, insert commands to create three new folders. Choose some cool names for your folders.

○ Next, insert commands to navigate inside one of the folders you created and create three new folders inside this folder. Also, insert commands to remove two of the directories you created.

● Create a batch file called ‘ifExample’. Inside it, add an if statement to make a new folder called ‘ifFolder’ if one of the folders you created is named ‘newFolder’.

● Next, add an if-else statement that makes a new folder called ‘hyperiondev’ if an ‘ifFolder’ exists, or else make a new folder called ‘reactProjects’ if it does not.
